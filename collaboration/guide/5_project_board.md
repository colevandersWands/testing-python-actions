# Project Board

Setting up your Project Board should be easy enough, using it well will take a
lot of discipline and attention to detail!

## Columns

Finally, create your project board and add these columns:

1. **TODO**: Unclaimed challenges that no one is working on.
1. **DOING** Challenges someone has assigned to themselves and is actively
   working on.
   - Each group member can only have _one_ claimed issue in the DOING column at
     a time.
   - Use the `help wanted` label in this column if you are blocked.
1. **READY FOR REVIEW**: Issues with a linked PR to review.
   - After your issue is READY FOR REVIEW you can claim a new challenge from the
     TODO column.
1. **UNDER REVIEW**: After assigning yourself to review a challenge in the READY
   FOR REVIEW column, move the issue to this column.
   - Issues stay in this column until the reviewer has approved the solution and
     merged it to `main`.
1. **DONE**: After merging a solution and closing the issue, the reviewer moves
   challege issued to this column.

## Issues

Create one _**issue**_ for each interesting challenge you think someone in your
group may want to solve. I's always ok to add more issue later, so no need to
spend hours cluttering the project board right away. There's also no maximum!
Your TODO column can be as full as you like.

Be sure each issue has:

- A full description of the challenge. This doesn't need to be as thorough as a
  docstring, but it should be clear enough that others can start solving it
  without asking you for help.
- Links to any helpful references or resources for solving this challenge.
