# Project Board

Setting up your Project Board should be easy enough, using it well will take a lot of discipline and attention to detail!

## Columns

Finally, create your project board and add these columns:

1. **TODO**: Claimed and unclaimed issues that no one is actively working on.
2. **DOING** Tasks someone is actively working on. Use the `help wanted` label
   in this column if you are blocked.
3. **READY FOR REVIEW**: Issues with a linked PR to review. If changes are
   requested you can move the issue back to _Todo_ or _Doing_.
4. **NEEDS REVISION**: PRs that were reviewed and are not ready to merge. If
   this is your PR you can move it back to _Doing_ when you're ready to fix it.
5. **DONE**: Issues that have been closed for any reason including: the linked
   PR was merged, the discussion has finished, or the task is no longer
   necessary.

When your columns are ready, move all of your issues into the _**Todo**_ column
and you're ready to go!

## Issues

Create one _**issue**_ for each challenge in the language you are studying (Python or C++). Maybe you start by only creating issues for the challenges your group decided to focus on in the **objectives** phase of planning - for example _dynamic_programming_ or _backtracking_ challenges. I's always ok to add more issue later, so no need to spend hours cluttering the project board right away.

Be sure each issue has:

- A _milestone_ to mark which type of challenge it is
- A checklist to track your progress on this task

And remember, you aren't limited to the challenges that come with this repository! You can always create issues for new challenges you dream of, or find online. The only constraint is that you apply the same quality and formatting standards to your new challenges as to the challenges already in this repository.

## Labels

You can use labels to add extra information to your tasks, making it easier for your teammates to know what's happening, and easier for them to help you when you need it.
GitHub repositories already come with a collection of helpful labels, but you can always add more if your group sees the need.

Some useful labels that are already in your repository:

- _good first issue_
- _help wanted_
- _question_
- _duplicate_

Some useful labels you may want to add:

- _notes_
