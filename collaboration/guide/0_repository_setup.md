# Repository Setup

Before diving into your project make sure your team has all the practical things
in place. This step isn't very hard but everything will go more smoothly if you take the time to do this correctly at the beginning.

## Setup and Share a Repository

As a team you will choose the name for your project's repository and select
someone from your team to be the repo owner. This person will fork this repository and configure it for collaboration:

- Public face of your repository (optional)
  - Change your repository's name
  - Change your [repository description](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7757751/how-do-you-change-a-repository-description-on-github)
  - Add or remove topics from your repository
- Under settings in your repository select:
  - _Issues_
  - _Discussions_
  - _Projects_
  - _Always suggest updating pull request branches_
- Collaboration Settings
  - Add everyone in your team as a contributor with _Admin_ access
  - Require a code review for PRs to `main`/`master`

    [github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/approving-a-pull-request-with-required-reviews)\)
    - You will need to type `master` into the _Branch name pattern_
      input box. (or type `main` if you have changed your default branch)
  - Select these settings to protect matching branches:
    - _Require approvals_
    - _Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed_
    - _Require approval of the most recent reviewable push_
    - _Require conversation resolution before merging_
    - _Do not allow bypassing the above settings_
