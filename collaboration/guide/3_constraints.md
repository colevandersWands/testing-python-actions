# Constraints

After dreaming big, the most helpful thing you can can do to define your project
is to be clear about _what it isn't_. Thinking big is great for brainstorming
but can get in the way of finishing your projects on time.

An important step to _scoping_ your project is to discuss your group's
**constraints** before you even begin thinking of user stories. Defining your
constraints will help to define a realistic project and commit to it.
Constraints can also help you to build a more creative project!

It may not sound intuitive, but the fewer restrictions you have on your work the
less likely you are to find a creative solution! The crucial skills you need to
learn is how to place _constructive_ constraints on your project and on your
team.
