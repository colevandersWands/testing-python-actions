# Objectives

The first step to developing a software project is to make sure everyone agrees
on the project objectives. For these exercises, setting objectives means
discussing what everyone wants to learn from these exercises.

For example, do you want to;

- Review DSs and algorithms you have already studied.
- Learn new DSs and algorithms.
- Practice using new programming language features.
- Practice more complete, readable, and documented solutions.
- Learn to program faster, to be more a more efficient developer.
- Focus on code review, going through several cycles of feedback for each
  solution.
- ... or anything else you can think of

There are no wrong answers, it's ok if everyone has different objectives! Shat's
important is that everyone has the same expectations.

## `/collaboration/learning_goals.md`

Write your group's objectives for these exercises in
[/collaboration/learning_goals.md](../learning_goals.md). If different members
have different objectives, you can write this in the `learning_goals.md` file.
You don't need to have one description for everyone!
